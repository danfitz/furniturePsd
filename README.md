# furniturePsd

Given a set of PSDs and assets by a designer at my bootcamp, I was required to fully replicate the desktop view of the site using HTML and CSS (via Sass).

To accommodate responsiveness, I then had to create the mobile and tablet view of the site using the desktop view PSDs as a branding guide.

## Tools Used

* HTML
