# furniturePsd

Given a set of PSDs and assets by a designer at [Juno's bootcamp](https://junocollege.com/bootcamp/), I was required to fully replicate the desktop view of the site using only HTML and CSS (via Sass).

To accommodate responsiveness, I then had to *invent* the mobile and tablet view of the site using the desktop view PSDs as a design guide.

## Tools Used

* HTML
* CSS and Sass
